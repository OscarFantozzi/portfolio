                            This project consists of a small automation that I developed because I wanted to monitor the prices of different brands of cell phones on an important Brazilian retail website. 
                            The approach involved using the Selenium library to extract the data and export it to an Excel spreadsheet. The data extraction part is now complete.  
                        
                        </p>

                        <h4>Next Steps:</h4>
                        <p>
                            The idea for the future is to create an app using Streamlit or a simple HTML website where users can enter the brand and price range they want to track, along with their email address. 
                            After that, it will be necessary to integrate the email sending logic so that the script sends a report containing information about the desired cell phone and the price range.
                            This project is still ongoing.
