                <img src="img/income_statement_img/data_modelling.png" alt="Data Model Diagram">

                <h4>fBudget Table</h4>
                <h4>Relationships:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Relationship with dChartOfAccounts:</b> 
                        The `fBudget` table relates to the `dChartOfAccounts` table through the `ChartOfAccounts_id` column in `fBudget`, which corresponds to the `id` column in `dChartOfAccounts`. This relationship is used to associate each budget record with its respective chart of accounts.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Relationship with dCalendar:</b> 
                        The `fBudget` table relates to the `dCalendar` table through the `AccrualDate` column in `fBudget`, which corresponds to the `Date` column in `dCalendar`. This relationship allows associating each budget record with a specific calendar date.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>fForecast Table</h4>
                <h4>Relationships:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Relationship with dChartOfAccounts:</b> 
                        The `fForecast` table relates to the `dChartOfAccounts` table through the `ChartOfAccounts_id` column in `fForecast`, which corresponds to the `id` column in `dChartOfAccounts`. This relationship is used to associate each forecast with its respective chart of accounts.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Relationship with dCalendar:</b> 
                        The `fForecast` table relates to the `dCalendar` table through the `AccrualDate` column in `fForecast`, which corresponds to the `Date` column in `dCalendar`. This relationship allows associating each forecast with a specific calendar date.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>fTransactions Table</h4>
                <h4>Relationships:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Relationship with dChartOfAccounts:</b> 
                        The `fTransactions` table relates to the `dChartOfAccounts` table through the `ChartOfAccounts_id` column in `fTransactions`, which corresponds to the `id` column in `dChartOfAccounts`. This relationship is used to associate each transaction with its respective chart of accounts.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Relationship with dCalendar:</b> 
                        The `fTransactions` table relates to the `dCalendar` table through the `AccrualDate` column in `fTransactions`, which corresponds to the `Date` column in `dCalendar`. This relationship allows associating each transaction with a specific calendar date.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Explanation of Data Modeling</h4>
                <p>
                    The presented data modeling uses the star schema concept to organize fact and dimension tables, enabling efficient analysis of financial data.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Dimension Tables (dCalendar, dChartOfAccounts, dIncomeStatementShape):</b> These tables provide detailed descriptions and hierarchies to categorize and describe fact data.</li>
                    <li><b>Fact Tables (fBudget, fForecast, fTransactions):</b> These tables store quantitative and transactional data to be analyzed, such as budgeted, forecasted, and actual amounts.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Relationship between IncomeStatementTemplate and ChartOfAccounts</h4>
                <p>
                    The relationship between the income statement template (`IncomeStatementTemplate_id`) and the chart of accounts (`ChartOfAccounts_id`) is crucial for ensuring that financial transactions, budgets, and forecasts are correctly categorized and reported.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Income Statement Template:</b> Defines the structure and layout of the income statement, specifying how different types of transactions should be grouped and presented. This is essential for ensuring that financial reports are consistent and understandable.</li>
                    <li><b>Chart of Accounts:</b> Provides a detailed list of all accounts used in the company's accounting, organizing them according to the structure defined by the income statement template.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    By relating these two tables, we ensure that each transaction, budget, or forecast is associated with the correct category, facilitating the creation of accurate and consistent financial reports. This allows financial management to have a clear and detailed view of the company's performance at different levels and accounting categories.
